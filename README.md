# nopNES
This is a NES Emulator that I'm working on as a side project.  
This means that there may occasionally be gaps of no progress between commits.  
## Running (Windows)
In the bin/Debug folder, there is a file called nopNES.exe.  
Download that, as well as pal.pal and put those in a seperate folder.  
Put your roms there as well.  
From there, download the DLL files in the bin/Debug folder and put those in there as well.  
Then, double click on nopNES.exe to run it.  
Enter the name of the rom and play.  
NOTE!  Windows builds are experimental and may contain bugs!  
OTHER NOTE!  Windows builds do not currently have input working.  I'm not sure why.  
## Running (Linux)
In the bin/Debug folder, there is a file called nopNES.  
Download that, as well as pal.pal and put those in a seperate folder.  
Put your roms there as well.  
From there, open a terminal and navigate to the place that you put nopNES and the roms.  
Type ./nopNES and press enter.  
Enter the name of the rom and play.
