# nopNES
This is a NES Emulator that I'm working on as a side project.  
This means that there may occasionally be gaps of no progress between commits.  
## Running (Windows)
Don't have a windows build running yet.  
## Running (Linux)
In the bin/Debug folder, there is a file called nopNES.  
Download that and put it in a seperate folder.  
Put your roms there as well.  
From there, open a terminal and navigate to the place that you put nopNES and the roms.  
Type ./nopNES and press enter.  
## Notes
There is not currently a windows build  
## Controls
