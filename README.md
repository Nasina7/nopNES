# nopNES
This is a NES Emulator that I'm working on as a side project.  
This means that there may occasionally be gaps of no progress between commits.  
## Running (Windows)
In the bin/Debug folder, there is a file called nopNES.exe.  
Download that, as well as pal.pal and put those in a seperate folder.  
Put your roms there as well.  
Then, double click on nopNES.exe to run it.  
If it complains about not having SDL2.dll, download that, put it with the executable and try again  
Enter the name of the rom and play.  
NOTE!  Windows builds are untested and experimental and may contain bugs!  
## Running (Linux)
In the bin/Debug folder, there is a file called nopNES.  
Download that, as well as pal.pal and put those in a seperate folder.  
Put your roms there as well.  
From there, open a terminal and navigate to the place that you put nopNES and the roms.  
Type ./nopNES and press enter.  
Enter the name of the rom and play.
